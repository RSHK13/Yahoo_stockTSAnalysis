# Yahoo_stockTSAnalysis

This project goes through some of the ways of modelling Time series data to predict Yahoo stock prices. Here we'll be using some deeplearning techiniques like SimpleRNN, LSTM(with different parameters). All the models are tested rigorously on R1 and R2 statistics to fine tune parameters.
